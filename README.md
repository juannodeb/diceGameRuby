### About

diceGame is an game application I developed to improve my programming/developer skills. The one on
this specific repository was made entirely with ruby. A future version would be an API made within Rails
and the front-end would be made out of Vue, ReactJS or NextJS.

The app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/juannodeb/diceGameRuby).
